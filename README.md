# FritzDect2MQTT

[![en](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-en-red.svg)](README.md) | [![de](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-de-green.svg)](README.de.md)

## 📦 Overview

This project reads data from **Fritz!DECT smart sockets** connected to a FritzBox via
the **AHA HTTP API** (using [fritzconnection](https://fritzconnection.readthedocs.io))
and publishes it to an **MQTT broker**. It can also **switch sockets on/off** via MQTT.

It runs as a small **Docker Compose** service on any Linux host (originally built for a
Raspberry Pi). A previous variant targeted QNAP NAS — that build path has been removed
in favour of the simpler Compose setup below.

> Personal/hobby project. The full change history is in the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).

## 🎯 Background & goal

This project was created to connect Fritz!DECT power sockets to a **Voron 3D printer**
running **Klipper / Moonraker / Mainsail**. The goals are:

1. **History values in the database** — record the socket's consumption (power/energy) so it
   is stored alongside Moonraker's job history table.
2. **Live display in Mainsail** — show the socket's current stats (power draw, voltage,
   current, temperature) directly in the Mainsail web UI.

Both are achieved by publishing the socket data to MQTT (this project) and consuming it on
the Moonraker side via its `[mqtt]`, `[sensor]` and `[power]` integrations.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📡 **MQTT publish** of per-socket name, temperature, power, energy, voltage, current
- 🔀 **Switching via MQTT** (`set_switch`) using the AHA HTTP interface
- 🔁 **Reconnection handling** for the MQTT connection
- 🔧 **Threading**: querying and command-listening run in parallel
- 📊 **Device statistics** via `getbasicdevicestats` (voltage / derived current)
- 🧹 **Container-native logging** to stdout, rotated by Docker (`json-file`)

## 🔌 MQTT data model

| Direction | Topic | Payload |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| publish (state) | `<maintoken>/<FB>/<AIN>` | `{"AIN": "...", "name": "...", "temp": 21.0, "power": 7.46, "allpower": 29.4, "voltage": 233.3, "current": 0.03}` |
| subscribe (command) | `<cmdtoken>/<FB>/<AIN>` | `{"action": "set_switch", "data": {"AIN": "...", "switchstate": "on"}}` |

Defaults: `maintoken = sensor/FB`, `cmdtoken = cmd/FB`, `<FB>` = the `QUERY.FB` name.
The command tree is intentionally **separate** from the state tree so the client never
receives its own published messages. `switchstate` accepts `on`/`off`, `true`/`false`,
`1`/`0` (string or JSON boolean).

Example (PowerShell with the mosquitto clients):

```powershell
.\mosquitto_pub.exe -h <broker> -p 1883 -t "cmd/FB/MyFritzbox/116570608608" `
  -m '{\"action\": \"set_switch\", \"data\": {\"AIN\": \"116570608608\", \"switchstate\": \"off\"}}'
```

## 🐳 Docker installation (recommended)

The image bakes in the code, dependencies and `configdata.cfg` (see
[`docker/Dockerfile`](docker/Dockerfile)). **Only `secrets.yaml` is mounted from the
host** — it must never be committed to Git. `TIME_ZONE` is passed as an environment
variable; the container joins an external Docker network (`web_net` by default).

**Prepare the secret on the Docker host** (once):

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /opt/docker-data/fritzdect2mqtt
# create /opt/docker-data/fritzdect2mqtt/secrets.yaml from _secrets.yaml in this repo
sudo $EDITOR /opt/docker-data/fritzdect2mqtt/secrets.yaml
sudo chmod 600 /opt/docker-data/fritzdect2mqtt/secrets.yaml
docker network create web_net    # only if it does not exist yet
```

### Option A — Git deploy via dockhand (recommended, this is what is tested)

This project is **deployed and tested with [dockhand](https://github.com/fnsys/dockhand)**
using its *Deploy from Git* feature, so a `git push` is the only action needed to roll
out a change:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Repository URL | `https://github.com/SirRenix/FritzDect2MQTT.git` |
| Branch | `main` |
| Credential | `None (public)` |
| Compose file path | `docker/compose.yaml` |
| **Context directory** | **`.`** (repository root — **required**) |
| Build images on deploy | **on** |
| Enable webhook | on (point your GitHub webhook at the dockhand URL) |
| Environment variable | `TIME_ZONE=Europe/Berlin` |

> ⚠️ **Set _Context directory_ to `.`** — without it dockhand uses the compose file's
> directory (`docker/`) as the build context, so the build cannot find the app files at
> the repository root (`requirements.txt`, `*.py`) and fails with
> `lstat .../docker: no such file or directory`. With `.` the whole repo is the build
> context and `build.context: ..` in `docker/compose.yaml` resolves correctly.

### Option B — plain Docker Compose

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SirRenix/FritzDect2MQTT.git
cd FritzDect2MQTT
TIME_ZONE=Europe/Berlin docker compose -f docker/compose.yaml up -d --build
```

Logs go to stdout and are captured/rotated by Docker (`json-file`, 10 MB × 3):

```bash
docker compose -f docker/compose.yaml logs -f
# or:  docker logs -f fritzdect2mqtt
```

---

## 🧪 Manual installation (without Docker, optional)

Runs on any Linux machine with Python 3.10+:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-venv
cd FritzDect2MQTT
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

cp _secrets.yaml secrets.yaml   # then edit credentials
python FritzDect2MQTT.py
```

To run it permanently, wrap it in a systemd service (or your supervisor of choice)
that starts `python FritzDect2MQTT.py` from the project directory.

## ⚙️ Configuration (`configdata.cfg`)

| Key | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| `QUERY.FB` | Name of the FritzBox entry in `secrets.yaml` |
| `QUERY.AINS` | `ALL` or a list of specific AINs to query |
| `QUERY.looptime` | Seconds between query cycles (default 30; change requires restart) |
| `MQTT.broker` | Which `MQTT_BROKER` entry in `secrets.yaml` to use (default `RASPI`) |
| `MQTT.maintoken` | Base topic for published state data |
| `MQTT.cmdtoken` | Base topic for incoming switch commands |
| `MQTT.clientId` | MQTT client id |
| `logging` | Standard Python `logging.config.dictConfig` block |
